About
The metaBEAT script will process raw Illumina reads and assign taxonomy, exporting a table with assigned reads.

The output of the metaBEAT script are the files: 
(1) Riaz_12S-trim30_crop114_min90_merge-forwonly_nonchimera_c1cov3_blast95-by-taxonomy-readcounts.blast.csv (assigned reads)
(2) Riaz_12S-trim30_crop114_min90_merge-forwonly_nonchimera_c1cov3_blast95_unassigned-by-taxonomy-readcounts.blast.csv (originally unassigned reads)

These are stored in the folder 04_taxonomic_assignment

See the repository README for instructions on setting up an environment for running the metaBEAT script.
